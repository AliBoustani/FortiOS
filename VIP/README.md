# FortiOS Virtual IP

Recently I was involved in a project that required many vip creations with specific ports.

I couldn't find any API or Ansible Module to do that, so I decided to create this script to automate this process.


Note* I use .xlsx as the input file, due to the fact that the project that I was involved used this format to store their documents !!
You also will notice that I set the default protocol on TCP which vividly is changeable by your needs!
